Changes the permissions user level, i.e. Site Admin, Job Admin, Basic user

This endpoint will only convert the user to a Basic user. Other permission levels are not supported due to security constraints. This means changing the user permission level is not reversible through this endpoint.

When converting a user’s permission level to Basic, any previously assigned job-based, developer, or user-specific permissions will be removed. Note that this will remove the user from assigned roles on any jobs, e.g. Recruiter or Coordinator. This will also remove the user from any outstanding approval flows.

}
```

Creates a new unverified e-mail address on the given user. The address will not be considered verified until the user receives the verification e-mail and clicks on the link to verify the address. There is no method in the API to verify an e-mail address. This endpoint is also used to re-send a verification e-mail. The request body to do this is exactly the same. If an unverified e-mail is received with send_verification set to true, Greenhouse will attempt to re-send the verification e-mail. If you attempt this with a verified e-mail, nothing occurs.

### HTTP Request

### JSON Body Parameters

Parameter | Required | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------
email | Yes | string | The user's email address. Must be a valid email address.
send_verification | No | boolean | If true, an email will be sent to the user to verify this e-mail address. If false, nothing happens. Default is false.

There are 3 successful response states for this endpoint.

* 201: A new e-mail address was received and created. This will be the response code regardless of the verification setting.
* 200: An e-mail was generated for an unverified e-mail address. This is the case if we attempt to re-send a verification e-mail to an unverified e-mail address.
* 204: A request was made which caused Greenhouse to do nothing. This will occur if you attempt to re-send a verification e-mail to an address that has already been verified or if you make a follow-up request to an unverified e-mail with send_verification set to false.
